Q3: Can you trigger a revert in the init code in Remix?

Response: If we send value while deploying the contract it will revert because is not payable. 
due to the function read is view and it does not revert it will never revert.

Q5: Can you think of a situation where the opcode EXTCODECOPY is used ?

Response: At EVM level guess it should be used to know if the calling contract has specific functions.
